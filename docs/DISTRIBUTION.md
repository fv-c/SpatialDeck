# Distribution, exports and presenter (0.6)

SpatialDeck 0.6 adds the `spatialdeck` command line, publishable package layouts, a standalone offline HTML, a static web build, a PDF and a minimal WebM video of an explicit itinerary, the presenter view and an offline Studio shell. Every output is rendered by the same DOM/CSS 3D player; there is no second renderer. Verification, measurements and limits: [phase-0.6 report](verification/phase-0.6.md).

## Running the CLI

From the repository (Node 24.22.0, pnpm 12.14.0):

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build
pnpm spatialdeck --help
pnpm spatialdeck validate examples/distribution-static/project.json
pnpm spatialdeck export html examples/distribution-static/project.json --out deck.html
pnpm spatialdeck build examples/distribution-static/project.json --out site
pnpm spatialdeck export pdf examples/distribution-static/project.json --itinerary examples/distribution-static/itinerary.json --out deck.pdf
pnpm spatialdeck export video examples/distribution-static/project.json --itinerary examples/distribution-static/itinerary.json --fps 30 --out deck.webm
```

`pnpm spatialdeck` runs `packages/cli/dist/cli.js`, so it needs `pnpm build` first. Installed from its tarball the binary is `spatialdeck`.

`<project>` is a project JSON, whose assets are resolved inside its own directory, or a `.spatialdeck` archive. Exit codes: **0** success (warnings allowed), **1** invalid project, itinerary or capability, **2** missing environment (Chromium, FFmpeg), **3** write or export failure. An existing output needs `--overwrite`; a build directory is replaced only if it holds a previous `export-manifest.json`. Files are written to a temporary sibling and renamed atomically; a failed export leaves no output. Tools run with an argument vector, never through a shell. Nothing is installed automatically: `npx playwright@1.64.1 install chromium` (or `pnpm exec playwright install chromium` here) and FFmpeg come from the user.

Options: `--allow-partial` (placeholders, status `partial`), `--reduced-motion` (PDF/video planned without transitions), `--lang en|it` (player interface texts; default from `metadata.language`), `--frames <empty dir>` (video: keep the captured PNG frames).

## Inputs and confinement

- Project JSON: validated and migrated in memory to 1.3.0; the file is never rewritten. Asset paths must be safe relative paths (no `..`, absolute, encoded or backslash paths) and may not go through a symbolic link anywhere below the project directory. Each file is checked against the declared size, MIME signature and SHA-256 when declared; the manifest records the computed digest.
- Archive: the same reader as Studio (`readArchive`): central/local header coherence, CRC, digests, limits after inflation, no traversal, no links.
- Limits: JSON 10 MiB, 50 MiB per asset, 200 MiB in total, itinerary 1 MiB and 500 visits.

## Profiles

Exports are **strict** by default. A blocking finding fails with exit 1 and writes nothing; `--allow-partial` replaces the content with a visible placeholder ("Content unavailable (type)") and records it in `warnings` and `unsupported`.

Private scene notes are removed from every output (`publicDocument`); the manifest says `"privateNotes": "excluded"`. The authored project keeps them.

## Standalone HTML

One file with the export runtime (a classic IIFE script built from the published player and plugins ESM), the player and KaTeX stylesheets with their woff2 fonts as `data:` URLs (one format, only the stylesheets the document needs), the public project JSON and the verified assets as base64 data blocks turned into `Blob` URLs at run time. A `<noscript>` outline lists the titles and accessible texts of the default path. Third-party licences are embedded in `<template id="spatialdeck-notices">`; the header comment states the GPL-3.0-or-later licence of the runtime and the source repository.

Content Security Policy (meta element):

```
default-src 'none'; script-src 'sha256-…'; style-src 'sha256-…'; img-src blob:; media-src blob:;
font-src data:; connect-src 'none'; frame-src 'none'; worker-src 'none'; object-src 'none';
base-uri 'none'; form-action 'none'
```

**Decision on KaTeX inline styles (taken at the start of 0.6):** no `'unsafe-inline'` for styles. KaTeX formulas are built with `katex.render`, which creates DOM nodes and assigns its positioning styles through CSSOM properties; CSP governs parsed `style` attributes and `<style>` elements, not CSSOM, and the player already applies transforms and theme tokens through CSSOM. The previous `renderToString` + `innerHTML` sink is gone. Two KaTeX features set a `style` attribute on MathML nodes with `setAttribute` (`\pmb` and `\fcolorbox`); under this CSP those attributes are blocked and reported, with no visual effect because the MathML copy is visually hidden. They are not used by the fixtures.

The JSON blocks escape `<`, `>`, `&`, U+2028 and U+2029, so a `</script>` in the content stays text; the inline runtime has every `</script` and `<!--` rewritten to `\x3C…`. The file opens from `file://` with the network disabled. Size target: 25 MiB (warning `HTML_SIZE` above). `file://` has no reliable origin: the presenter view is not available there (single window only).

## Static build

`index.html` with `script-src 'self'`, `style-src 'self'`, `font-src 'self'` and `connect-src 'self'`: the runtime fetches `project.json` and the assets listed in a data block, verifies them like the archive reader and plays. Fonts are files. Serve it over HTTP(S); `fetch` from `file://` is not supported by browsers. `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` sits next to the runtime.

## Itinerary

```json
{
  "pathId": "main",
  "visits": [{ "nodeId": "n1" }, { "nodeId": "n2" }, { "nodeId": "n3" }]
}
```

At most 500 visits, finite, with explicit repetitions for loops. Consecutive visits must be connected by an edge of the path; `edgeIdToNext` is required when several edges join the same nodes and must be absent on the last visit. Visit limits (`loopPolicy`, `visit-limit`) are checked with the runtime rule. The first visit is placed without transition; the total is the sum of every `holdMs` plus the edges between visits. A track starts from the previous arrival pose, never from its saved first keyframe, and its endpoint is the arrival pose. Core API: `validateItinerary`, `planCapture`, `sampleCapture`, `frameSchedule` (see DEVELOPMENT).

## PDF

Chromium for Playwright 1.64.1, viewport equal to the document viewport, DPR 1. For each visit the player renders the arrival pose with `renderAt` (renderers, fonts and two paints ready) and Chromium prints that single page; the pages are then joined with pdf-lib without re-rendering. Printing several 3D-transformed pages in one Chromium document misplaced the content, so a per-visit print is used. Text of a frontal scene stays vector text; Chromium may rasterise layers seen in perspective. Page size: the viewport in CSS pixels (1280×720 → 960×540 pt). The CLI counts pages and page boxes in its own output and refuses a mismatch.

## Video

Only the static profile: text, Markdown, HTML, SVG, LaTeX, images, links as static text and camera transitions; no audio track. N = ceil(totalMs × fps / 1000) frames at t = i × 1000 / fps (i = 0…N−1), rendered with `renderAt` and captured as PNG, then encoded by FFmpeg with the first WebM encoder listed by `ffmpeg -encoders` among libvpx-vp9, libvpx (VP8), libsvtav1 and libaom-av1, single-threaded with bitexact flags. `ffprobe` counts the frames and reads the duration: the export fails unless the count is N, the duration N / fps within one frame and the size the viewport. The exact end instant is not a frame: give the last visit a hold of at least one frame to show its arrival pose (warning `FINAL_HOLD_SHORT` otherwise). The plan fixes reduced motion (`--reduced-motion` re-plans without transitions), independently of the capturing browser. Same environment, same frames: the manifest records a digest of all PNG frames. H.264 is not offered; the FFmpeg binary is not distributed. Codec licences: libvpx and the AV1 encoders are BSD-licensed and royalty-free; the FFmpeg build itself is the user's.

## ExportManifest

```
{ format, status: complete|partial, toolVersion, schemaVersion, source, itinerary?, profile,
  privateNotes: "excluded", resources: [{id, kind, path?, mime?, byteLength?, sha256, status}],
  licenses, warnings, unsupported, environment, verification, output: {file, byteLength, sha256} }
```

`verification` lists only checks the run performed on its own output: parsed JSON blocks, CSP hashes and absence of notes (HTML); file digests (build); page count, page boxes and the rendered pose matrix against the sampler (PDF); ffprobe frames, duration and size and the pose matrix (video). It never claims an offline test: that is the E2E suite's job.

Every manifest has `license: GPL-3.0-or-later`, description, repository, homepage, keywords, `sideEffects`, `engines` and a README; `pnpm pack` adds the repository `LICENSE`. Internal dependencies become the same version in the tarball. A build plugin fails if a library chunk contains a module from `node_modules`; IIFE builds generate their notice file from the bundled modules and fail on a missing or incompatible licence. The packages stay `"private": true`: ownership of the `@spatialdeck` npm scope could not be verified (registry 404 on 26 October 2026), so publishing remains blocked by G0 point 2.

`pnpm check:packages` packs the five packages, installs the tarballs in `test-results/packages/consumer` (own pnpm workspace, packages from the local store when present and registry metadata only when missing, third-party runtime dependencies pinned to the repository lockfile versions, no source aliases), type-checks without `skipLibCheck`, builds a minimal and a realistic consumer and measures them; the E2E suite serves that consumer and runs the CLI installed from its tarball.

## Presenter view (Studio)

**Relatore** in the Studio toolbar opens the public window (`present.html`, a page without React) on the click and turns Studio into the presenter console: current scene, next visit preview or branch choices, private notes, a monotonic timer (start, pause, reset) and navigation. The console is the only navigation authority; keys, outline and choices in the public window become requests to it. Messages use `postMessage` between opener and popup with origin and source checks, a random 128-bit session ID, a strict schema and increasing sequence numbers per page load. The console also probes the popup with a random nonce that the public window repeats in its messages: after the presenter tab reloads, WebKit reports the wrong `event.source` and only a reference found again by window name can reach the public window, so **Riprendi vista relatore** finds the window by name on the click and the nonce proves the replies come from it. A reloaded public window or presenter tab resynchronises from a snapshot of the public document (notes removed) and the resource blobs. Previews are muted; audio plays only in the public window. A blocked popup shows instructions, a retry and a single-window presentation. **Schermo intero** in the public window and **Presenta** request the browser fullscreen on the user's gesture. Limits: no guarantee against operating-system mirroring; multi-display placement is the browser's; full support needs a local host or HTTPS (not `file://`).

## Offline Studio shell

The production Studio registers a versioned service worker (`sw.js`, generated at build time with the list of built files). After the first load the shell works offline and projects reopen from IndexedDB. A new version installs in the background and waits: a notice offers **Aggiorna e ricarica**, which first flushes unsaved work to local recovery; only then the new worker activates and deletes older `spatialdeck-studio-*` caches, never other caches or IndexedDB data. The player, the playground and the exported HTML do not use the worker. Development (`pnpm dev:studio`) never registers it.
